## 4. Description Of Services

We are providing an application (the "Service") aimed at simplifying the process of sharing schedules by making it quick to
broadcast (via SMS) your availability to friends you've added to your circle.
By automating some of the awkward away, we hope to promote more social time for children.

The Service is designed to assist parents and guardians ("users", "you") in determining overlaps in free time between their children's schedules and their friends'. Children may not access or log into the service. The service does not perform any identity verification beyond confirming the validity of phone numbers through a confirmation link. The service does not offer searchability to connect with people unless you know their phone number. The service does not store actual meetings.

Our Service includes the following key features:

1. **Schedule Management:** Users can easily create, edit, and view schedules to facilitate the organization of play dates. Users can attach emoticons to highlight periods they need coverage for as well as notes for specific openings. Our platform helps identify potential overlaps in free time between different households.

2. **Circle of Friends:** Users can create a circle of friends - a list of other households that they (their household) are friends with. This circle serves as a primary source for potential play dates. Users can invite friends to join their circle and vice versa.

3. **Household Management:** Users, specifically adults in a household, have full control over the management of their household information. This includes editing the household nickname and public notes/FAQ, adding/removing/editing childrenâ€™s information, inviting or removing other adults to manage the household, and more.

4. **Sharing of Information:** Upon accepting a friend invite from another household (or inviting another household to join their circle), users agree to share their household's schedule and notes, nickname, household's parents' names, parents' numbers, parent's notification status, children's names, dates of birth, and pronouns with that household. The Privacy Policy outlines the information that is collected and shared. This Shared Information helps friends in the circle to view and understand the availability of each household for play dates.

5. **SMS Based Authentication and Communication:** We have adopted an SMS-based system for login and communication, offering a user-friendly and secure experience. By entering your phone number, you can receive a login link via SMS. This same channel is also used to broadcast texts to parents when you're free and send reminders to update schedules.

6. **Automatic Reminders:** The Service offers automated reminders that help parents remember to fill out their schedules, keeping the system updated and functional.

7. **Schedule broadcasts** The Service offers automated SMS broadcasts to parents in your circle when you're free, helping to facilitate the scheduling of play dates.

8. **Password-free security** The Service exclusively uses SMS-based authentication (Magic Links) and does not use or store passwords, in order to keep user data safe. Using a login link sent to your phone will open your browser and set a cookie that will keep you logged in. This cookie is not accessible to other websites and is only used to keep you logged in to the Service.

## 5. Registration

1. During registration, you will be required to affirm that you are over 18 years of age and that you have read the Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy. The Services are exclusively for the use of adults and guardians and may not be used by minors.

2. To use the Service, you are required to register an account. When you register for an account, you may be required to provide us with some information about yourself, such as your phone number, first and last name, and other contact information. You agree that the information you provide to us is accurate, and that you will not register for an account on behalf of an individual other than yourself or otherwise impersonate any other person.

3. Upon registration, you will use your phone number to receive a magic login link for authentication. This number must be valid and under your control. We use this for account access and to provide you with necessary updates and notices. Please note that if you change your phone number, you will need to create a new account. You can maintain your household by logging in to your old account and adding your new account to the household. Then log into the new account and remove the old account from the household to prevent a potential new recipient of that phone number from accessing your household.

4. Users who create an account must be at least 18 years old. We do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13. If we discover that we have collected information from a child under 13 years of age, we will delete that information immediately.

5. It is important that you maintain the confidentiality of your account, including any login link sent to your phone. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account, loss of your phone number, or any other breach of security. You may be held liable for any loss or damage from your failure to protect your account information.

6. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account if any information provided during the registration process or thereafter proves to be inaccurate, false, or misleading, or to reclaim any username that you create through the Service that violates our Terms of Use. If you have any questions about your account setup or the registration process, please contact us at the email address provided on our website.
