## 5. Description Of Services

We are providing an application (the "Service") aimed at simplifying the process of sharing schedules by making it quick to
broadcast (via SMS) your availability to friends you've added to your circle.
By automating some of the awkward away, we hope to promote more social time for children.

The Service is designed to assist parents and guardians ("users", "you") in determining overlaps in free time between their children's schedules and their friends'. Children may not access or log into the service. The service does not perform any identity verification beyond confirming the validity of phone numbers through a confirmation link. The service does not offer searchability to connect with people unless you know their phone number. The service does not store actual meetings.

Our Service includes the following key features:

1. **Schedule Management:** Users can easily create, edit, and view schedules to facilitate the organization of play dates. Users can attach emoticons to highlight periods they need coverage for as well as notes for specific openings. Our platform helps identify potential overlaps in free time between different households.

2. **Circle of Friends:** Users can create a circle of friends - a list of other households that they (their household) are friends with. This circle serves as a primary source for potential play dates. Users can invite friends to join their circle and vice versa.

3. **Household Management:** Users, specifically adults in a household, have full control over the management of their household information. This includes editing the household nickname and public notes/FAQ, adding/removing/editing children’s information, inviting or removing other adults to manage the household, and more.

4. **Sharing of Information:** Upon accepting a friend invite from another household (or inviting another household to join their circle), users agree to share their household's schedule and notes, nickname, household's parents' names, parents' numbers, parent's notification status, children's names, dates of birth, and pronouns with that household. The Privacy Policy outlines the information that is collected and shared. This Shared Information helps friends in the circle to view and understand the availability of each household for play dates.

5. **SMS Based Authentication and Communication:** We have adopted an SMS-based system for login and communication, offering a user-friendly and secure experience. By entering your phone number, you can receive a login link via SMS. This same channel is also used to broadcast texts to parents when you're free and send reminders to update schedules.

6. **Automatic Reminders:** The Service offers automated reminders that help parents remember to fill out their schedules, keeping the system updated and functional.

7. **Schedule broadcasts** The Service offers automated SMS broadcasts to parents in your circle when you're free, helping to facilitate the scheduling of play dates.

8. **Password-free security** The Service exclusively uses SMS-based authentication (Magic Links) and does not use or store passwords, in order to keep user data safe. Using a login link sent to your phone will open your browser and set a cookie that will keep you logged in. This cookie is not accessible to other websites and is only used to keep you logged in to the Service.

## 6. Information Collected

By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you are 18 years of age or older.

1. **User Information**: This includes your first and last name, phone number, email (optional), locale (language preference), time zone, and chosen pronouns. It also records whether your account is locked, why it might be locked, and your preferred reminder times and intervals. The date and time you accepted the terms of use are also noted.

2. **Household Information**: For your household, the app collects the name of the household, public notes that you might add (optional), and the names of other members you've added to the household (optional).

3. **Child Information**: For each child in the household, the app collects their first name, pronouns, and optionally their last name and date of birth as well as their association with the household.

The app may also store information about your device, such as the device type, operating system, and browser type.

9. **User-provided Notes**: The app allows users to enter arbitrary text into their Household notes, FAQ and schedule. This information is stored and shared with other households in the user's circle. The Service does not review or moderate this information.
