The Playdate.help application provides services aimed at simplifying the process of sharing schedules and organizing playdates for children. The service is designed to assist parents and guardians in determining overlaps in free time between their children's schedules and their friends' schedules. The application does not perform identity verification beyond confirming the validity of phone numbers through a confirmation link and does not store actual meetings.

The key features of the Service include schedule management, circle of friends, household management, sharing of information, SMS-based authentication and communication, automatic reminders, schedule broadcasts, and password-free security.

The information collected by Playdate.help includes user information (such as name, phone number, email, locale, time zone, and chosen pronouns), household information (household name, public notes, and names and phone numbers of household members), child information (first name, pronouns, and optional last name and date of birth), contact permissions, availability information (dates, start and end times, availability status, and notes or emoticons), friend requests and household connections, invitations to manage the household, safety and login information, and user-provided notes.

Access to this information is provided to anonymous users, logged-in members, household adult members, friends of the household, Playdate.help administration, and third-party services. Anonymous users have limited access, while logged-in members can edit their profiles or delete them. Household adult members have more privileges, including editing household information, managing household members, inviting friends, editing schedules, and viewing the dashboard.

The Service uses essential cookies for authentication, security, and basic functionality. It does not use non-essential cookies for analytics or advertising purposes. Users can set their browsers to refuse or alert them about cookies, although this may impact the functionality of the website.

The Service is hosted in the United States and accepts phone numbers from the United States and Canada. Information may be transferred to and maintained on computers located outside the user's jurisdiction.

The Service is not intended for use by children under the age of 13, and Playdate.help does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.
